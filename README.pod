=head1 NAME

Tie::Scalar::Ratio - a scalar which multiplies in value every time it is accessed.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Tie::Scalar::Ratio;

  tie(my $doubler, 'Tie::Scalar::Ratio', 2, 1);

  print $doubler; # 1
  print $doubler; # 2
  print $doubler; # 4
  print $doubler; # 8

  tie(my $halver, 'Tie::Scalar::Ratio', 0.5, 80);

  print $halver; # 80
  print $halver; # 40
  print $halver; # 20
  print $halver; # 10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Tie::Scalar::Ratio> is a class for creating tied scalars which multiply their
value by a ratio everytime their value is read. I found this a useful way to
make a C<retry()> function increase its sleep duration after every attempt,
without re-writing the function (I just passed a C<Tie::Scalar::Ratio> object
as the duration scalar).

Similarly by passing a ratio value less than 1, it can be used as a timeout or
countdown feature.
